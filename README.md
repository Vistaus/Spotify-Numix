Spotify-Numix-ish
==================

The Numix-ish theme for Spotify.

ATTENTION: Spotify Numix-ish is discontinued due to an upcoming major overhaul of Spotify's interface which would destroy all my work. I had expected to re-do a couple of things after an update, but I hadn't expected a major overhaul. It's gonna require waaaay too much effort to start from scratch with the new interface again.
And also because their theme engine (let's call it that) is a bit broken, so I couldn't ever finish the theme 100% even if I wanted to. I'm sorry, guys and gals. But I'll keep the repo open.

Installation
==================

-Clone the repo and navigate to the folder.

-Select all files and folders from the theme section of the repo and compress them to a ZIP file named "resources.zip" (without the quotes).
DON'T (!) name it anything other than that. Really, don't.

-Open up your favorite file manager as sudo/root (for example: gksu nautilus) and navigate to the spotify-client/Data folder
of Spotify. On Ubuntu and alike this is in /opt, on Arch Linux and alike this is in /usr/share/spotify

-Copy the resources.zip file you made and paste it into the Data folder. Overwrite the current resources.zip in that folder.
(you may backup the original should you want to revert back)

-Now open up Spotify and there you go!

(of course, terminal buffs may do the whole thing by terminal, you'll get the idea for the commands from the instructions)
