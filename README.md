Spotify-Numix-ish
==================

The Numix-ish theme for Spotify.
NOTE: it's currently a WIP so don't bother opening up a GitHub Issue, I know it's not done yet. If I announce it's done
and something's wrong, then you may bug me. 

Installation
==================

ATTENTION: FEB 2 2014
DON'T follow the instructions below, I need to update the instructions because of a change in my repo. I'll remove this message
when it's useable again.

-Clone the repo and navigate to the folder.

-Select all files and folders from the repo and compress them to a ZIP file named "resources.zip" (without the quotes).
DON'T (!) name it anything other than that. Really, don't.

-Open up your favorite file manager as sudo/root (for example: gksu nautilus) and navigate to the spotify-client/Data folder
of Spotify. On Ubuntu and alike this is in /opt, on Arch Linux and alike this is in /usr/share/spotify

-Copy the resources.zip file you made and paste it into the Data folder. Overwrite the current resources.zip in that folder.
(you may backup the original should you want to revert back)

-Now open up Spotify and there you go!

(of course, terminal buffs may do the whole thing by terminal, you'll get the idea for the commands from the instructions)
